# C++ Practice Repository for DSA Journey

## Overview

Welcome to my C++ practice repository!  
I'm using this folder to upload all my C++ codes as I learn and practice Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Every code I write in VS Codeâ€”whether it's about control statements, if-else conditions, loops, practice questions, projects, or any new DSA conceptâ€”is automatically uploaded here. This repository will keep growing as I continue my DSA journey.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Beginner C++ Concepts:**  
  Control statements, if-else, loops, etc.

- **Practice Problems:**  
  Solutions and approaches to coding questions from various platforms and study material.

- **Projects:**  
  Small or large projects created during my learning process.

- **DSA Codes:**  
  Implementations of data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.) and algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion, etc.).

## Why This Repository?

- To keep a record of my daily progress in C++ and DSA.
- So that I can revisit and improve my old solutions.
- To help others who are also starting with C++ and DSA.
- For easy access and backup of all my codes.

## How to Use

- Browse the folders/files to find codes for different topics.
- Each file usually contains a problem statement (in comments) and its solution.
- You can use these codes as reference or modify them for your own practice.

## Note

- This repository is mainly for practice and learning. Code style and documentation may improve as I progress.
- If you find any issue or want to suggest improvements, feel free to open an issue or pull request.

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
