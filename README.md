# 🧠 DSA with C++ 🚀

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) journey using **C++**!  
This repository contains all the important DSA topics I’m learning step-by-step from scratch — from basic C++ concepts to advanced algorithms.

---

## 📌 What You'll Find Here:

- ✅ C++ Basics (Variables, Loops, Arrays, Strings)
- 🔁 Recursion & Backtracking
- 🧮 Sorting & Searching Algorithms
- 📚 Stack, Queue, Linked List
- 🌳 Trees, Binary Trees, BSTs
- 🏛️ Heaps, Hashing, Graphs
- 🧩 Dynamic Programming
- 💡 Problem-solving on Striver Sheet, GFG & Leetcode

---

## 📅 Roadmap & Resources

I’m following a mix of:

- 📘 [Striver's DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/)
- 🎥 [Striver's DSA A-Z Playlist on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKZaSt2df1g8I1D8Q432pYKYV4zKcxw4q)
- 💻 GeeksforGeeks & LeetCode for extra practice

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Environment

- Language: `C++`
- IDE: `Visual Studio Code`
- Compiler: `g++ (MinGW / MSYS64)`
- Version Control: `Git + GitHub`

---

## 📈 My Goal

> 🔥 **Become confident in DSA by October 2025 for placements and internship opportunities.**  
Building strong core fundamentals in C++ and DSA for real-world problem solving.
